# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# What I learned while making a YouTube clone

- I learned interacting with external APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.
- Implementing a robust search mechanism that allows users to filter videos based on specific queries or keywords by selecting from feed categories and search queries.
- I use React's component-based structure to create reusable and modular UI elements.
- I use  React-Player package library component to provide a seamless video viewing experience within the application.
